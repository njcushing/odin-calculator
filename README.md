# odin-calculator
A basic calculator interface with the four common operators: addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division. The calculator has both mouse and keyboard
functionality. The buttons are as follows:



0-9 (0-9 on keyboard, respectively) - Appends the current value with the given digit.

'+' (+/= on keyboard, no shift required) - Adds the current value to the stored value.

'-' (- on keyboard) - Subtracts the current value from the stored value.

'x' (x on keyboard, not asterisk) - Multiplies the stored value by the current value.

'รท' (/ on keyboard) - Divides the stored value by the current value.

'.' (. on keyboard) - Adds a decimal point to the current value.

'=' (Enter on keyboard) - Resolves the current calculation (if applicable). Can also
    be used to 'chain' together calculations; repeatedly pressing equals after a
    calculation will continue to repeat the most recent calculation with the stored
    value.

'CE' (ESC on keyboard) - Clears the current and stored values and resets the calculator.

'DEL' (Backspace on keyboard) - If currently inputting the current value, removes the
    last digit (or decimal point) from the current value.
